# GPU-Based Ultrasound Simulation using k-Wave

This repository provides MATLAB scripts for performing GPU-accelerated 2D ultrasound wave propagation simulations using the [k-Wave Toolbox](http://www.k-wave.org/). The simulations generate received channel data from virtual phantoms under various transmit angles.

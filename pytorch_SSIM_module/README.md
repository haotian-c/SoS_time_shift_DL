# Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for PyTorch

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), a widely used image quality metric that evaluates perceptual similarity between two images. It includes both a callable function and a PyTorch module class for easy integration into deep learning pipelines.
